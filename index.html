    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Flowers come in a wide variety. Some are colorful, some smell good, some are poisonous, and others do not even need soil to grow! Here is information for three different flowers.</p>

    <p>Roses naturally grow in several colors, and people often use the colors to symbolize things. For example, red roses represent love, and yellow roses are used to show friendship. There are rose gardens around the world, and the largest ones have hundreds of rose varieties and thousands of rose bushes.</p>

    <p>The Rafflesia arnoldii is the largest flower in the world and can be found in the rainforests of Sumatra. It is also called the corpse lily because of its unpleasant smell. Although humans do not enjoy it, the smell attracts insects that help pollinate the flower. Rafflesia flowers are hard to find, and the buds take months to develop.</p>
